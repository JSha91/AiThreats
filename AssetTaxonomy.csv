Data,Augmented Data Set,"An augmented data set is a (usually labeled) data set which has been augmented by adding data produced by transformations or by generative ML models. Augmentation significantly increases labeled data sets’ diversity (which is supposed to prevent overfitting) in view of using augmented datasets for training other ML models. In image recognition, data augmentation techniques include cropping, padding, and horizontal flipping.",Data Pre-processing
Data,Evaluation Data,"The evaluation data is used to evaluate the predictive quality of the trained model. The ML system evaluates predictive performance by comparing predictions on the evaluation data set with true values (known as ground truth) using a variety of metrics.",Model Tuning
Data,Labeled Data Set,"The term “Labeled Data” refers to a set of scalar or multi-dimensional data items that have been tagged with one or more informative labels, usually for the purpose of training a supervised ML model.",Data Pre-processing
Data,Metric Data Set,"The sorts of numbers we collect when we measure something. Metric data can be ratio scale, interval scale, integer scale, and cardinal numbers.",Feature Selection
Data,Pre-processed Data Set,"The data is pre-processed before feeding it into our ML model.",Data Pre-processing
Data,Public Data set,"Public data set is information that can be freely used, reused, and redistributed by anyone with no existing local, national, or international legal restrictions on access or usage.",Data Exploration,Data Ingestion
Data,Raw Data,"Raw data refers to any type of information gathered for AI analysis purposes, possibly after cleaning but before it is transformed or analyzed in any way.",Data Ingestion
Data,Testing Data,"It is a dataset used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final ML model fitted on the training dataset. We use testing data to test the model. If the data in the test dataset has never been used in training (e.g. in cross-validation), the test dataset is also called a holdout dataset.",Model Training
Data,Training Data,"Training data refers to the initial data that is used to develop a ML model, from which the model adapts its internal parameters to refine its rules.",Model Selection / Building,Model Training,Transfer Learning
